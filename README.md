# Human Body Visualizer

A human body visualizer with an interactive UI to learn about the body. This project was originally designed to help users learn about the body and what specific exercises target which body parts.

## TODO:

- [x] Import svg of human body
- [x] Reconfigure svg so that each polygon is independent of each other (so it's easier to code interactive part)
- [x] Import Tailwind and ShadCN UI to add styling
- [x] Add interactivity
  - [x] Add hover effect
  - [x] Add click effect
- [x] Make it so it corresponds to data value when clicked
